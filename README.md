# Bird Sanctuary Solution Repo

This repo contains solution code for the bird sanctuary lab. In this readme, you'll find some tips for how to navigate the solution code.

## Navigating the solution code

- Run `git branch` to see a list of available git branches. Hit `q` to exit the editor when you are done looking at the branches.
  - Each branch in this repo contains one more step in completing this lab
  - The first two branches contain code that sets up a static app and implements the initial application state. The remaining branches implement one feature in a test suite.

_Exercise: Use git to figure out what the last numbered branch is._

- To switch branches, use `git checkout`. For example, if you want to view the solution code that creates a static app, run `git checkout 1-static-app`.

_Excercise: Use git to navigate to the branch `2-add-state`._

- To look at what changes have been made across two branches of a repo, use `git diff`. For example, if you wanted to see what code had been added to complete the bonus items feature, you would:
  - run `git checkout 6-bonus-items` to pull up the solution code for the bonus items feature
  - run `git diff 5-apply-discount` to see what changes were made to the project to implement the bonus items feature since the last step was completed

_Exercise: Use git to figure out which files were updated in the second step (`2-add-state`)_

_Note: If you make changes to the code on a branch, git wonâ€™t let you switch branches without either stashing or committing your work. If you want to save your work and update the branch, add and commit your code first. Otherwise, you may run `git stash` before navigating to another branch._

# Lab Instructions

## Getting Started

- Fork this repo
- Clone the forked repository
- `cd` to the directory where you cloned it
- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npm run cypress` to open the cypress testing window

> _Note_: Remember to `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` regularly

## Submission Guidelines

- When finished, commit and push your work.
- Make a pull request on github.
- Submit the link to your pull request on Canvas.

This challenge is designed to assess the React skills you have gained so far.

There are 7 features that need to be implemented. Each completed function (passes all the tests) will be worth 1 point.

A minium of 5 points must be attained in order to pass this assessment.

You may receive partial credit (0.5 points) for code that is close to passing the tests, but does not pass all the tests.

## Assessment Details

Create a bird sanctuary donation app that meets the user stories below.

**The birds are in the array in `src/data/birds.js` and the bonus itesms are in `src/data/bonusItems.js`. Import these and pass them to your components. Use these items and do not change any information in the array, or else the tests will fail.**

The following demo has been styled for clarity. You do not need to style this app.

## User Stories

1. I can see sections with birds, that have a name, image, amount and adopt button.
1. I can see add birds to the shopping cart.
1. I can see a total cost of the birds in my cart.
1. I can get a 10% discount if I have 3 or more birds in my cart
1. I can get a series of bonus items for increasing cart totals
1. I can use a form to checkout my cart, upon checkout, it resets my cart
1. I can delete a bird from my cart

## Acceptance criteria and tests

The acceptance criteria below are covered by unit tests. Notice that there are some important details about the exact text, classes, or HTML tags you'll need to use in order to pass the tests.

Your react app should be made up of a minimum of 3 components:

- bird card(s)
- checkout
- cart

### Birds

- The bird data comes from `src/data/birds.js`
- Each bird card displays the name, image, and amount (price)
- Each bird card has a class name of `birds`
- Each bird card has an `Adopt` button
  - The button text should be: `Adopt`

### Cart

- The cart has a class name of `Cart`
- When I click on a bird card's adopt button, its name appears in the cart as an `<ol>` list item.
- The total shows up as an `<h4>` element inside the cart
- When I click on an additional item, the total cost is updated and additional bird name(s) is added as a list item to the unordered list
- When there are less than 3 birds in the cart there is a 0% discount
- When there are 3 or more birds in the cart there is a 10% discount

The bonuses come from `src/data/bonusItems.js`

- The bonus items are added as list items in an `<ul>` list item as follows:
- 1 bonus (first array item) is given if the total is between 100 and 300
- 2 bonuses (first and second array items) are given if the total is between 300 and 500
- 3 bonuses are given if the total is between 500 and 1000
- 4 bonuses are given if the total is more than 1000

### Checkout

- I can complete the inputs in the checkout form.
- When I complete the form with valid input and click `Submit`, an alert tells me the purchase was successful.
  - Alert text should include: `You have adopted birds. Thank you!`
- When I close the alert box, the cart component should fully reset (no birds, no discount, total = 0, no bonus items listed)

## Help and tips

- Before you write any code, think about your component structure.

  - What components will you need to represent the parts of the app?
  - Which components will need to have state?
  - Which components will need to know about the state of **other components**?
  - Which components will need to get props (data or callbacks) from another component?
  - Which components will be rendered by other components?
  - Draw out your component structure. Check your drawing against the user stories. Will you be able to implement all of the stories with this structure?

- If your tests are failing, read the acceptance criteria closely. Some tests expect you to use specific text, classes, or HTML elements.

## Academic Integrity

- Do this assessment **on your own**.
  - Do not pair program with other fellows.
  - Do not refer to work from other fellows.
  - Do not ask individuals outside the program for help.
- You can refer to any notes that you have.
- You can Google anything you want, but do not copy any code that you do not understand.
- Your instructors are here to help you with technical difficulties.
  - Make sure that the tests are running on your computer. If not, tell an instructor ASAP.
  - Make sure that you can fork and clone the repo and run the app. If not, tell an instructor ASAP.
